# Fitness-With-Angular


Fitness With Angular is a fitness tracker application that uses real-time database functionalities thanks to Firebase and AngularFire which allows users to see their updates almost instantly. NgRx is used as a Redux-inspired state management solution which enhances the app.

The app first asks users to sign up or they won't be able to access the different exercises. You will be asked to enter your email, a password which is at least 6 characters long, and a birthdate which must be at least 18 yrs old. The sign-up form also has validation so you must enter valid information such as an email that is not already in use.
